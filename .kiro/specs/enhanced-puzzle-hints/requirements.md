# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current jigsaw puzzle game provides hints every 4 hours by revealing individual puzzle pieces in their correct positions with transparency. However, this approach doesn't effectively help users understand the "bigger picture" of the puzzle. This feature enhancement will improve the hint system to provide more meaningful visual context that helps players understand the overall image composition, themes, and structure, making the puzzle-solving experience more engaging and educational.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a puzzle player, I want hints to reveal contextual information about the bigger picture, so that I can better understand what I'm assembling and make more informed piece placement decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a hint is requested THEN the system SHALL display a low-resolution preview of the complete image with highlighted regions
2. WHEN a hint is used THEN the system SHALL show thematic groupings or color patterns that help identify related pieces
3. WHEN multiple hints are used THEN the system SHALL progressively reveal more detail about the overall composition
4. IF a hint reveals a section THEN the system SHALL provide contextual labels or descriptions about that area

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a puzzle player, I want the hint system to guide me toward understanding the image's main subjects and composition, so that I can develop a strategy for completing the puzzle.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the first hint is used THEN the system SHALL reveal the main subject or focal point of the image
2. WHEN subsequent hints are used THEN the system SHALL reveal secondary elements in order of importance
3. WHEN a hint is displayed THEN the system SHALL show how revealed areas relate to the overall composition
4. IF the image contains recognizable objects or scenes THEN the system SHALL provide descriptive hints about what is being shown

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a puzzle player, I want hints to help me identify edge pieces and corner pieces more effectively, so that I can establish the puzzle framework first.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a hint is requested AND no edge pieces are placed THEN the system SHALL prioritize revealing edge and corner piece locations
2. WHEN edge hints are shown THEN the system SHALL highlight the puzzle border structure
3. WHEN corner pieces are revealed THEN the system SHALL show how they anchor the overall composition
4. IF edge pieces are already placed THEN the system SHALL focus on interior composition hints

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a puzzle player, I want the hint system to adapt to my progress, so that hints become more targeted and useful as I advance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fewer than 25% of pieces are placed THEN the system SHALL focus on structural and edge hints
2. WHEN 25-50% of pieces are placed THEN the system SHALL reveal major compositional elements
3. WHEN 50-75% of pieces are placed THEN the system SHALL provide detail-focused hints for remaining areas
4. WHEN more than 75% of pieces are placed THEN the system SHALL give precise placement hints for final pieces

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a puzzle player, I want to see a mini-map or overview that shows my progress in context of the bigger picture, so that I can understand how my completed sections fit into the whole.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game is running THEN the system SHALL display a small overview showing completed vs incomplete regions
2. WHEN pieces are placed correctly THEN the system SHALL update the overview to reflect progress
3. WHEN viewing the overview THEN the system SHALL highlight areas that would benefit from the next hint
4. IF a hint is active THEN the system SHALL show the hint context within the overview

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a puzzle player, I want hints to include visual cues about color gradients, patterns, and textures, so that I can better match pieces based on visual characteristics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a hint is displayed THEN the system SHALL highlight dominant colors in the revealed area
2. WHEN showing texture hints THEN the system SHALL emphasize pattern continuity across piece boundaries
3. WHEN revealing gradients THEN the system SHALL show the direction and flow of color transitions
4. IF similar patterns exist elsewhere THEN the system SHALL indicate potential matching areas
